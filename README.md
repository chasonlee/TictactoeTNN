Topological neural network based Tictactoe AI

## Description
- This is a topological neural network structure, which includes the input layer, hidden layer, and output layer.  The main difference between the regular neural network structure and the topological neural network lies in the hidden layer. The hidden layer is no longer structured like an array; instead, it is a topology. This implies that any node can connect to any other node in the hidden layer. 
-  Topological neural networks have been extensively studied, such as [NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT)](http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf).
